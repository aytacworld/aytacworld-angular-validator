## Usage

import { email, url } from 'aytacworld-angular-validator';
@Component({

export class App {
  public myForm: FormGroup = this.fb.group({
    email: ['', email()],
    website: ['', url(true)],
    message: ['', Validators.required],

`email() = is mandatory` and `email(true) = optional(can be null/undefined/empty string or an email)`
